#### Constructive Heuristic
- DSatur  
  * Take node with maximum degree of saturation that means maximum number of colored neighbour
  * Tie break by more degree


* * *
1. Courses are nodes.
2. Constraints are edges.
3. Implemented the Hard Constraint hardcoded.
4. LargestDegreeHeuristic done but not sure if it is the correct ans.

***
### To Do
- [x] Same pair of nodes don't create another edge.
