#### Constructive Heuristic
- DSatur  
  * Take node with maximum degree of saturation that means maximum number of colored neighbour
  * Tie break by more degree

1. Courses are nodes.
2. Constraints are edges.
3. Implemented the Hard Constraint hardcoded.
4. LargestDegreeHeuristic done but not sure if it is the correct ans.

***
### To Do
- [x] Same pair of nodes don't create another edge.
- [ ] Average penalty is still faulty. It's just adding one edge once but one edge may represent multiple students.
- [ ] Also same edge is being calculated in the penalty twice.
